# Schematron
The Schematron files in this repository are to support GEMINI 2.3 validation.

There are two files:
* GEMINI 2.3 Schematron Schema: tests requirements of GEMINI which are stricter than those of ISO 19139:2007. Reports triggered by these rules should be treated as validation errors.

* GEMINI 2.3 supplemental: tests recommedations of GEMINI. Reports triggered by these rules should be treated as warnings, or hints for possible improvement.

They were prepared in 2018 by BGS under contract to AGI, funded by Defra, and are released under CC-BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), as is the rest of GEMINI.

The home of GEMINI is https://www.agi.org.uk/gemini/. Issues with GEMINI itself (as opposed to the Schematron files) are managed at https://github.com/agiorguk/gemini

Note: Defra sponsored creation of Schematron files to support validation of the older GEMINI 2.2, which are still available via https://guidance.data.gov.uk/publish_and_manage_data/harvest_or_add_data/harvest_data/gemini/#iso-19139.
